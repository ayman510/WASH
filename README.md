# Systems Modeling to Improve River, Riparian and Wetlands Habitat Quality and Area

Managing river systems requires an understanding of the interaction between stream ecology and hydrology. The suitability of a watershed physical habitat to support the livelihood and productivity of its biota primarily depends on managing flow. Habitat conservation and restoration efforts require an understanding and a measurement of the spatial and temporal ecological response to alterations in flow regimes. Managers use deterministic and qualitative measures such as habitat quality indexes to measure ecological response of particular species at certain locations and times to flow alterations. We propose improving habitat management decision-making by incorporating habitat quality indexes as objectives to maximize in a systems optimization model. The **Watershed Area of Suitable Habitat (WASH)** systems model uses habitat quality indexes to measure physically-available suitable habitat. WASH adds spatial and temporal functionality to quality indexes to recommend environmental flows for aquatic, floodplains, and wetland habitats while maintaining water for human beneficial uses. WASH also highlights promising restoration and conservation sites. In addition, WASH proposes and ranks alternatives for managers to restore and protect natural habitat. WASH formulation is generic and adaptable to other regulated river systems and for species of concern. We apply the model to the Lower Bear River, Utah as a case study to improve degraded habitat and communicate tradeoffs between human and ecosystem uses of water. Results show that the River is largely developed and appropriated for human water uses. However, increasing reservoirs winter releases and minimizing spring spill volumes can create additional suitable habitat area without harming human users. WASH results are displayed on an open-access web map that allows stakeholders to visualize opportunities to manage water and improve habitat quality and area

## Objectives of WASH
* Quantify suitable habitat area within a watershed by embedding habitat quality indexes in a systems model, and
* Identify strategies to allocate scare natural (e.g. water) and management (e.g. financial) resources to improve habitat quality.

## Features of WASH
1. Allocates water to maximize ecological benefits at the watershed,
2. Considers multiple aquatic, floodplain, and wetlands habitats,
3. Accounts for competing ecological needs of water for multiple species and their life stage-water needs,
4. Considers temporal and spatial dependency between flow control structures at the watershed,
5. Meets human beneficial use of available water,
6. dentify sites in the watershed where managers can most improve ecosystem functions with limited water, and
7. Is generic and adaptable to other sites and species

## WASH Formulation
To improve river habitat quality, managers, first, identify watershed component targets that are in need of restoration. Here, we include the common areas of habitat management within a watershed: aquatic, floodplain, and impounded wetland habitats (Figure 2). Next, we select indicator species for each habitat component. Indicator species are organisms that (a) their presence can be monitored and their abundance can be measured, (b) have an ecological and managerial significance, and (c) their habitat requirements are directly impacted by flow regime conditions.  Then, we design habitat suitability indexes as functions of flow components, such as water depth and flood recurrence. These functions are site- and species-dependent and are based on the tolerance of species to changes in hydrologic and ecologic conditions. We measure hydrologic changes by controlling reservoir releases and storage volumes in addition to diversion volumes. We also control vegetation cover of indicator trees by revegetating the floodplains. These decision variables dictate the values of a group of state variables such as water depth, channel cross sectional area, reservoir surface area, storage and flood recurrence (Figure 1). We measure habitat performance by multiplying each suitability index [unitless] by an affected area. Habitat indicators are aggregated together using spatial and temporal weights to determine the overall WASH performance indicator value in unit area for the entire watershed. Expressing WASH in unit area (e.g. m2) helps communicate results to stakeholders and describe the implications of management actions over time. WASH model works with river systems as a group of nodes for demand sites and reservoirs and links for river reaches, diversions, and return flows.
